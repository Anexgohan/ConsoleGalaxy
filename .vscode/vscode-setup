Title:
VSCode setup for Starsector modding

Content:
This guide will help you set up Visual Studio Code for Starsector modding. 
It will cover setting up the IDE, installing the required extensions, and configuring the build tasks.

Steps:

(A). 
Setting up Java 1.7 (you can skip this step if you already have Java 1.7 installed) =>
Note: you can use any java version from 1.7, 1.8, till java 17, but 1.7 is recommended for Starsector modding.

1. Install Java 1.7 from [Java 1.7]

2. Extract the downloaded JDK7.zip to a folder. 
        For example the default java directory, 
        ```C:\Program Files\Java\JDK7```.

(B). 
Installing Visual Studio Code =>
1. Install Visual Studio Code from [VSCODE]
https://code.visualstudio.com/

2. Open Visual Studio Code. Go to the Extensions tab on the left sidebar and install the following extensions:
    - Extension Pack for Java by Microsoft (Java Extension Pack) - This extension pack includes the following extensions:
        * Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat
        * Debugger for Java
        * Test Runner for Java
        * Maven for Java
        * Project Manager for Java
        * Visual Studio IntelliCode (optional/not required/safe to uninstall)

3. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette and type `Java: Create Java Project`. 
        Select `Create Java Project` from the list.

4. Select `No build tools` and press Enter.

5. Select the mods folder inside the Starscetor installation folder as the project folder. 
        The path should look like this:
        ```Starsector\mods```

6. Enter the project name. The project name should be the name of the mod you are creating. 
        For example, if you are creating a mod called `MyMod`,  enter `MyMod` as the project name.
        The folder structure should end up looking like this:
        ```Starsector\mods\MyMod```
7. This will create the following files and folders inside the `MyMod` folder. This will start you up with a basic mod structure.
        - .vscode
            - settings.json
        - lib
        - src
        - README.md
Note: 
settings.json - This contains the configuration related to VSCode within the project
src - You will be writing your code in this folder, this is where the mod's source code goes, 
        anyone with this folder and the files contained inside it should be able to compile the mod

8. Open the `MyMod` folder in Visual Studio Code. File -> Open Folder -> Select the `MyMod` folder. This should load the project in VSCode.

9. In VSCode click on 'settings.json' in the .vscode folder. 
        Delete everything inside settings.json, Copy and Paste the following configuration to the settings.json file: 
```
{
    "java.project.sourcePaths": ["src"],
    "java.project.outputPath": "out\\vscode\\bin",
    "java.project.referencedLibraries": [
        "lib/**/*.jar",
        "d:\\Starsector\\starsector-core\\starfarer.api.jar",
        "d:\\Starsector\\starsector-core\\lwjgl.jar",
        "d:\\Starsector\\starsector-core\\lwjgl_util.jar",
        "d:\\Starsector\\starsector-core\\xstream-1.4.10.jar",
        "d:\\Starsector\\mods\\LazyLib\\jars\\LazyLib.jar",
        "d:\\Starsector\\mods\\MagicLib\\jars\\MagicLib.jar",
        "d:\\Starsector\\mods\\zz GraphicsLib\\jars\\Graphics.jar"
    ],
    "java.configuration.runtimes": [
        {
            "name":"JavaSE-1.7",
            "path":"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\JDK7",
            "default": true
        }
    ]
}
```
Note: this assumes that you have installed Starsector in the `D:\Starsector` directory. 
        If you have installed Starsector in a different directory, 
        you will need to update the paths in the `java.project.referencedLibraries` section.

You can add more libraries by also clicking on the `Add` button next to "Refrenced Libraries" tab

10. Save the settings.json file and restart VSCode and load the 'MyMod' project again.

(C). 
work on the mod =>
1. Start coding your mod in the `src` folder. Once you click any .java file in the `src` folder, 
        A new drop-down will appear at the left panel of the VSCode window called
        ```Java Projects```. 
        Click on the `MyMod` project to see the project structure.

2. Change the output folder of the compiled .jar file
        - Goto File -> Preferences -> Settings
        - Search for `Export Jar: Target Path`
        Change:
        ```${workspaceFolder}/${workspaceFolderBasename}.jar```
        to
        ```${workspaceFolder}/jars/${workspaceFolderBasename}.jar```
        in either 'User' or 'Workspace' settings
        you can also change the '${workspaceFolderBasename}' to anything you want. e.g. 
        ```${workspaceFolder}/jars/mymod.jar```

Congratulations you have successfully set up Visual Studio Code for Starsector modding.
